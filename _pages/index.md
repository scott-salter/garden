# Hi - I'm Scott! ðŸŒ±

This is my [[digital garden]]. It's my tiny plot of the internet where I share ideas and learn in public. 

These notes are written for myself and not necessarily for a third-party reader. So some notes may not make total sense, but that's okay. Some notes or ideas may be innacurate - and that's okay too. 

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Not sure where to start? I'd recommend my list of <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Topics]]</span> to get started on your exploration. You'll find a list of my most recently updated notes below, too.
</p>

Want to know more about me? My main website [Scott-Salter.com](https://scott-salter.com) has up to date information about my work, as well as a collection of blog posts. I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottsltr) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-salter/).

<strong>Recently updated notes</strong>

<ul>
  {% assign recent_notes = site.notes | sort: "last_modified_at_timestamp" | reverse %}
  {% for note in recent_notes limit: 5 %}
    <li>
      {{ note.last_modified_at | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }} â€” <a class="internal-link" href="{{ note.url }}">{{ note.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
