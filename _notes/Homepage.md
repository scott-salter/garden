This system has been designed to work with you, to help you reach your potential by helping you establish harmony with your thoughts and where you want to be in life. 

There are several parts to this system: 

**01 North Star** - This is where you unpick your goals. This is where you dive deeper into your aspirations and discover what you want from life.

## 02 Projects
This is where you track the open projects you are working on. Take notes and capture the tasks within each project note. 

## 03 Slip Box
This is the filing cabinet of the system. This is where your ideas or ideas from content you have consumed go and live, ready for you to develop them further or re-discover. 

## 04 Library
This is where you collect book, article, podcast notes. The thoughts here might be a little chaotic, but this serves as a dumping ground before ideas are reformed for your slip box. 

## 05 Workspaces
These are the different areas of your life that you want to define and for documents that won't fit into other categories. 

## 06 Outputs 
This is your content factory. This is where you draft your articles and content releases. 

## 07 Utilities 
The toolbox of your system. Information you repeatedly need, templates and bits that help your system work.
