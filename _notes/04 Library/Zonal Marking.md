## Highlights
- Cruyff said. ‘When you’ve got possession of the ball, you have to ensure that you have as much space as possible, and when you lose the ball you must minimise the space your opponent has. In fact, everything in football is a function of distance.’
- Michels considered Total Football to be about two separate things: position-switching and pressing.
- ‘The main aim of pressure football, “the hunt”, was regaining possession as soon as possible after the ball was lost in the opponents’ half,’
- ‘The “trapping” of the opponents is only possible when all the lines are pushed up and play close together.’
- The crucial, non-negotiable element of these systems was width. Regardless of the number of defenders, the tilt of the midfield or whether or not the centre-forward was supported by a number 10, Dutch coaches insisted on two touchline-hugging, chalk-on-the-boots wingers.
- Van Gaal’s reasoning was simple: if the wingers dragged the opposition full-backs wider, and the centre-forward forced the opposition centre-backs backwards, it would create more space for the star – the number 10.
- The Dutch press were so captivated by Bergkamp’s performances in the number 10 role that they felt compelled to invent a new term for it: schaduwspits, the ‘shadow striker’.
- That was the Dutch way: the number 9 sacrificing himself for the number 10,
- In typical Dutch fashion, Ajax had increased the active playing area by tempting Milan’s attack higher and forcing their defence deeper, thereby giving themselves more space in midfield.
- three qualities Dutch defenders would come to be renowned for – intelligence, speed and ball-playing ability.
- Cruyff admitted. But he believed there were only three passes that Barca needed to worry about: balls over the top would be intercepted by his goalkeeper, the aggressive Busquets; crossfield balls would be dealt with by his speedy full-backs Albert Ferrer and Sergi Barjuán, academy products and converted wingers; balls down the centre, meanwhile, wouldn’t be a problem because Cruyff was confident Koeman and Guardiola communicated well, and were flawless in a positional sense.
- Italian sides, though, weren’t about playing their natural game; they were about stopping opponents from playing theirs. They were – and still are – defensive-minded, reactive and tactically intelligent. Torricelli and Pessotto weren’t playing out of position, they were in another position they could play.
- Lippi and other Italian coaches had no defined system. They reacted to the opposition’s tactics to a greater extent than coaches elsewhere, and they routinely substituted star forwards to introduce defensive reinforcements.
- Although frequently used as a simple synonym for ‘negative football’, catenaccio – which literally means ‘door bolt’ – actually referred to a very specific defensive tactic: the use of a libero, or sweeper, playing behind ‘stopper’ centre-backs who performed strict man-marking duties on opposition forwards. The notion of a spare defender was a relatively novel idea, and inevitably meant a shortfall in more advanced positions, which generally produced defensive football.
- Portuguese focus on the transition was another way in which the country looked at the game structurally. It broke football down into four separate periods, which flowed in a continuous cycle: a team went from the possession phase, to transitioning to out of possession, to the out-of-possession phase, before transitioning back to the possession phase.
