## Highlights
- It starts with a simple and obvious idea: the only thing that we all have in common at work is that we want to be successful. It seems reasonable, then, that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the best managers help each person understand what is expected of them and then help each person find success.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">3→E↔R To put it in plain English, embrace these three (3) things—Direction, Coaching, Career—and as a manager of any organization, you will have engaged employees (E) who are delivering the expected results (R).</mark>
- Some common measurable engagement concepts below, along with some of the questions we ask to pin them down:
	- Fulfillment—“How fulfilled are you by the work that you do?” Discretionary Effort—“How willing are you to put in effort beyond what is expected?” Pride in Employer—“How much do you agree with the following statement: ‘I am proud to work at Employer’?” Employee Satisfaction (eSAT)—“Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with Employer as a place to work?”
	- Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS)—“How likely are you to recommend Employer as a place to work?” Intent to Leave/Intent to Stay—“How much do you agree with the following statement: ‘I am seriously considering leaving Employer’?”
- To me, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the job of the manager is so freakin’ simple, consisting of only two things, that it actually gets me a little hot under the collar when we overcomplicate it: Deliver an aligned result. Enable the success of the people on your teams.</mark>
- High expectations are important, but clear expectations are crucial. By focusing on little more than the success of the folks on your team, you ensure that each member is pursuing their clearly articulated portion of the aligned result and that you, the manager—the one who is responsible for everything that the team does or fails to do—will deliver it.
- Direction in a manager’s job is less about setting direction and more about ensuring direction is set. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Direction setting anchors the team to an aligned result through the combination of two long-term elements, purpose and vision, and two short-term elements: (1) objectives and key results (OKRs) and (2) ruthless prioritization.</mark> 
- Coaching enables team members to achieve those results. It comes in two forms: coaching to improve what’s not working and coaching to continue what is working. The former involves giving feedback that, no matter how hard we try, almost always induces a threat response; the latter involves helping folks explicitly understand what they have done well so they can do more of it. Career is the most overlooked element, but it is critical to employee engagement. A manager must do more than help employees succeed in the job they are doing now; they must help them discover their long-term vision for their careers and show them what actions they can take right now that will allow them to make tangible progress toward it. In doing this, you show employees that your care for them extends beyond what they can do for you or the company.
- How frequently does your manager solicit feedback from you? How consistently does your manager provide you with specific praise for good work?
- What is unique about these findings, though, is that they add up to a simple, coherent, contiguous, and economical leadership method—the Big 3—that measurably, reliably, and predictably drives both engagement and results. Simply, 3→E↔R.
- Over my twenty-eight years of leading people, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">I learned that people need clear expectations, the autonomy to craft and pursue their agendas, support to achieve success, and help thinking about their careers.</mark> These can be further boiled down to the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">three things that managers must provide their people: Direction, Coaching, and Career.</mark>
- The manager effectiveness questions that we can ask your team to find out if you are providing robust and clear direction to them are: How clearly does your manager communicate what is expected of you?
	- How helpful is your manager in prioritizing your work, including helping you figure out what not to work on?
	- How collaborative was your manager when setting your individual OKRs?
	- How collaborative was your manager when developing the team’s OKRs?
	- How helpful is your manager in assisting you to navigate company changes that impact you and your job?
	- How frequently does your manager solicit feedback from you?
	- How consistently does your manager provide you with specific praise for good performance?
	- How helpful is the feedback provided by your manager in improving your performance?
	- How responsive is your manager to your ideas or concerns?
	- How comfortable do you feel going to your manager with a safety concern, no matter how small?
	- How much do you agree with the following statement: “My manager cares about me as a human being”?
	- How supportive is your manager of your growth and development?
- Chuck’s <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">prescription for expectation setting is (1) make sure you know what you expect, (2) make sure your people know what you expect, (3) have a way to measure it, and (4) manage to those expectations.</mark>
- your job is to make sure direction is set, and that direction will be a higher-quality expression of your goals if you engage your people in setting that direction.
- For people to feel necessary, they must understand how their work ladders up within that broader context.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">To define purpose, one must ask the question, “Why does our team exist?”</mark>

## Vision 

- Vision is different from core purpose. While purpose is about why we exist, vision, in its most basic form, is making sure everyone has the same understanding of the common hill we are trying to climb.
- A vision statement describes the state of things at some point in the future—ideally in tangible terms, and more ideally still, in terms that are measurable or binary.
- Good vision statements read like descriptive sentences, and unlike the purpose statements we reviewed a few pages ago, they are not typically action oriented.
- When working with your team to set a vision, the first thing you need to do is decide on your time horizon.

## OKRs
- There are two major sources that I recommend regarding OKRs. First, Measure What Matters, a book by venture capitalist John Doerr, is as close to the source of truth about this practice as there is. Second, Betterworks is a Silicon Valley company that builds software to help organizations develop and manage their OKRs in an aligned way, top to bottom. I don’t have an opinion about their software, but their blog and the “resources” section of their website are exceptional!
- OKRs are a goal-setting system, and are composed of two major parts—an objective, and then underneath each objective, one or more key results.
- Third, they provide a basis for productive coaching. When we say that a manager’s job is to deliver an aligned result and enable the success of the people on their teams, the foundational idea beneath the aligned result is the OKR. That OKR invariably offers the manager a chance to enable greater success because it frequently reveals the need for a coaching intervention to improve, and it also reveals an opportunity to specifically call out great work by focusing on the things people should continue doing.
- KRs should be measurable or binary, with the ability to clearly and unambiguously determine success or failure. They should also include a deadline.
- A bad OKR leaves us without crystal clarity on exactly how we will measure or identify success. For some, this ambiguity is designed to dodge accountability. If there isn’t clarity about the shot we’re calling now, we might have a better chance to revise history at the end of the quarter and shape things to look like we succeeded.
- Just do not permit the OKR itself to be an input versus an output.

## Prioritisation

- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Prioritization is an exercise in subtraction, not addition.</mark>
- The leader needs to set the simple expectation that (1) we will prioritize at least every week in alignment with our goals and (2) our prioritization will be focused on a very small number of very important things.
- A couple simple practices I’ve seen work. First, Qualtrics asks each employee to write “snippets” each Monday morning, and we further ask them to subordinate their snippets to their OKRs.
- My team started using Slack for this. Each morning at 8:30, the Slackbot automatically prompted us with this question: “What are you working on today?” Then each of my direct reports and I highlighted our top priorities for that day. One small point here. You should really enforce a limit of three priorities for a day.
- Remember that prioritization is an exercise in subtraction, not addition. Avoid making task lists, and develop a very small number of true priorities for each day and each week.
- My team’s purpose is a function of the company’s purpose and my boss’s team’s purpose, et al. My team’s vision is a function of my team’s purpose and the higher organization’s vision. My team’s OKRs are a function of my team’s vision and the higher organization’s OKRs. My team and individual priorities are a function of my team’s OKRs.
- Zig responded, “Your job as a leader is to create clarity of expectations and to be a simplifier.
- I find that the basic idea of challenging people—because I think people like a challenge—is one such path. Challenging people is a critical idea in Liz Wiseman’s Multipliers. A Multiplier, as she describes it, is a leader who gets as much as two times more—more intelligence, more output, more productivity—than average from their teams.
- As I’ve heard Jared Smith, cofounder of Qualtrics, and Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter and partner at 01A, each say more times than I can count, “Managers who are trying to be liked create misery.”
- As a leader, you are tasked with making sure each team member is pursuing an aligned result. With that then secure, your job is to throw every ounce of energy into enabling the success of each person on the team. For them to be better, you must challenge them to do more than they ever thought they could.
- They guided us toward a five-to-one praise-to-criticism ratio. They were careful to say, “it’s not five to zero, it’s five to one” to make the point that correcting the kids was also critical to developing them.
- In other words, think twice before withholding praise because of some cockamamie contrived nonsense you’ve come up with to justify holding back. Say it, explain it, mean it. You and your teams will perform better.
- remember that when you are talking about someone and not to someone, you are not helping them. You are also not helping yourself to have the best experience you can have at work. A better way is to give your manager feedback directly.
- Step 1: Account for Your Risk
- Step 2: Gather the Boss’s Unique Context
- Step 3: Ask Permission
- Step 4: Just Do It
- The way to get here is to ask, ask, and ask some more. After you ask, listen. After you listen, act. People will start to see the pattern: my manager listens to me, values the input, occasionally makes changes based on the input, and then I don’t get fired but instead get applauded.
- What could be better on this team? If this was your budget, how would you spend it? How can I help you be even more successful? What do I need to do to better build trust with you? If you had a magic wand and could change one thing in the way we interact, what would that be? What improvements would you make to our team meeting? Why do you think the team’s engagement is sinking? What opportunities do you think the team is missing in the way we go to market? What could have been better about my presentation to the customer? What am I doing right now that is not helping you?
- The key skill here is active listening, and the key skill in active listening is repeating back what you heard.
- The greatest reward is to follow up. And just to be clear, following up does not necessarily mean you enact whatever suggestion you heard! As the person responsible for everything the team does or fails to do, you will need to exercise your own managerial discretion, but you must always follow up. If you decide not to enact the suggestion, it’s important to communicate why and encourage folks to continue to push you and the team to be better.
- Whether you’re delivering improve (critical) or continue (praise) coaching (feedback, guidance), using an effective structure for the impending conversation can help you deliver a cleaner, clearer message, but there is no existing nostrum that will diffuse the natural defensive reaction most humans have to criticism.
- managing and evaluating performance is fundamentally about two things: results and behaviors.
- The best coaching structure I’ve seen is the SBI model, which comes from the Center for Creative Leadership. SBI stands for Situation-Behavior-Impact.
- Situation—Describe the situation (or context, scenario, or interaction type) and be specific about when and where the behavior occurred. Behavior—Describe the observable behavior. Ideally, the behaviors in question come from a source, such as a handbook, a list of core values, or a set of level and functional guidelines. Steer clear of projecting or interpreting, and stick with what you have observed. Impact—Describe what you believe to be the impact of the behavior. In this case, we might be talking about the impact on others.
- While this structure is sound and elegant, I’ve found it to be insufficient in many cases because behaviors are not the only things we need to evaluate people on or help them improve or repeat in order to find success. We also have to work on, well … the work.
- here comes Russ Laraway, who on a Thursday in October, made up the SBI counterpart. I call it SWI, which means: Situation-Work-Impact. SWI.
- Situation—Describe the situation (or context, scenario, or typical interaction type), and be specific about which work product you are describing. Work—Describe how well the work product builds to results: the code, the copy, the customer service tickets, the sales pitch, the presentation slides, the presentation delivery, the financial model, the candidate experience strategy, etc. Impact—Describe the impact of the work on the business and on others. Why does this work matter? What result does it contribute to? How well do you believe it contributes, or how poorly?
- I offer a simple, one-sentence prescription to bridge the gap from silence to SB/WI. “I think I’m seeing some behavior that I believe is getting in your way. Are you in a spot where you can hear that right now?”
- By asking this question, you are effectively flagging that this might be a tough conversation and requesting permission to have it. And you are doing it in a way that gets you quickly into the real conversation.
- What are your thoughts about that?” That last part is important.
- it’s important to gather the other person’s perspective and try to understand it. I prefer this order, though, because it feels more authentic. I asked for the meeting, and so it seems appropriate that I lead it off.
- There are no enemies in the building. Great teams debate with the shared objective
- We shouldn’t be trying to win against each other in the workplace. We should be trying to win against our competitors.
- All of this builds to a simple idea: when you offer someone feedback, the best you can offer is what you see. You cannot offer them truth, right, or wrong. What you see, however, while limited, is extremely valuable.
- as Kim Scott notes in Radical Candor, giving the feedback right away “helps them fix it faster.”
- advice from author and tech executive Sheryl Sandberg: “When thinking about your career, you have to have a long-term vision and an eighteen-month plan.”
- Career Conversations are all about growth, yes, but critically, growth toward a dream. The path is (1) to the lighthouse and (2) (mostly) forward.
- Remember, when it comes to prioritization, 3>2>4; if you have more than three priorities, you have none.
- I believe we should instead think about long-term career aspirations within the pesky constraint of a whole lifetime. The bottom line is that this notion of a “ten-year plan” is just arbitrary, tends to promote shorter-term thinking, and is only slightly more addressable than the long-term vision.
- You as a manager do need to be able to address the short term, but the point is that these conversations should always formally and explicitly contemplate a long-term career vision.
