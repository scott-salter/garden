## Great Managers are made not born

- *p.9;* *Crucial conversations* (training course), *High output management* and *how to win friends and influence people* (books)
- p.10; managers share a common purpose: “helping a group of people achieve a common goal”
- p.10; great managers are made not born

## What is management

- p.16; a manager's job is to:
    - build a team that works well together
    - support members of the team in reaching their career goals
    - create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently
- p.19; your job as a manager is to get better outcomes from a group of people working together
- p.20; Andy Grove - former Intel CEO - wrote that when it comes to evaluations, you should look at “the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved”
- p.20; Chris Cox, Facebook’s Chief Product Officer, shared how he evaluates a manager:
    - “My framework is quite simple. Half of what I look at is a team’s results - did the team achieve it’s aspirations? The other half is based on the strength and satisfaction of the team - does the manager do a good job hiring and developing individuals - and is the team happy and working together well?”
    - The first criteria looks at the team’s present outcomes, the second criterion asks whether the team is set up for great outcomes in the future.
- p.22; research by J. Richard Heckman describes five conditions that increase a team’s odds of success:
    - having a real team (one with clear boundaries and stable membership)
    - a compelling direction
    - an enabling structure
    - a supportive organizational structure
    - expert coaching
- p.22; tasks that consume a manager’s day can be sorted into three buckets; **purpose, people and process.**
- p.22; the first big part of your job as manager is to ensure that your team knows what success looks like and cares about achieving it
- p.24; for managers, the important processes to master include running effective meetings, future proofing against past mistakes, planning for tomorrow and nurturing a healthy culture.

## Your first 3 months

**What to take advantage of - you’ve done the job before**

- p45; To be successful, you’ll need to unearth all the values and knowhow in your head and pass them along to others.
- p45; questions to ask yourself:
    - How do I make decisions?
    - What do I consider a job well done?
    - What are all the responsibilities I took care of when it was just me?
    - What’s easy or hard about working in this function?
    - What new processes are needed now that the team is growing?
- What to take advantage of - you get to build the team you want
    - What qualities do I want in a team member?
    - What skills does our team need to complement my own?
    - How should this team look and function in a year?
    - How will my own role and responsibilities evolve?
- p49; New managers should think about “how to calibrate their expectations around what is normal?”
    - What does it mean to do a great job versus an average or poor one? Can you give me examples?
    - Can you share your impression of how project X went? Why do you think that?
    - I noticed that Z happened the other day… is that normal or should I be concerned?
    - What keeps you up at night? Why?
    - How do you determine what to prioritise?

## Leading a small team
- p58; Managing a small team is about mastering a few basic fundamentals: developing a healthy manager-report relationship, and creating an environment of support.
- p58; Andy Grove in his book High Output Management: “What gets in the way of good work? There are only two possibilities. The first is that people don’t know how to do good work. The second is that they know how, but they aren’t motivated.”
- p59; Why would someone not be motivated to do great work? One possible answer is that he doesn’t have a clear picture of what great work looks like
- p59; The first step to addressing any concerns about lacklustre work is diagnosing the people issues behind it. Is it a matter of motivation or skill? This doesn’t have to be complicated. You can understand this through a series of conversations with your report. First, discuss whether your expectations are aligned - does great work mean the same thing for both of you? Then discuss whether it is a matter of motivation. If both of those don’t resolve your concerns, then dive into whether the issue is with skills.
- p61; Strive for all your one-on-one meetings to feel a little awkward. Why? Because the most important and meaningful conversations have that characteristic.
- p66; how to have stellar 1:1s.
    - **Discuss top priorities:** What are the one, two, three most critical outcomes for your report, and how can you help her tackle these challenges?
    - **Calibrate what “great” looks like:** Do you have a shared vision of what you’re working towards? Are you in sync about goals or expectations?
    - **Share feedback:** What feedback can you give that will help your report, and what can your report tell you that will make you more effective as a manager?
    - **Reflect on how things are going:** Once in a while, it’s useful to zoom out and talk about your report's general state of mind — how is he feeling on the whole? What’s making him satisfied or dissatisfied? Have any of his goals changed? What has he learned recently and what does he want to learn going forward?
- p67; Every morning, I’ve gotten into the habit of scanning my calendar and compiling a list of questions for each person I’m meeting with. Why questions? Because a coach’s best tool for understanding what’s going on is to ask.
- p67; here are some of my favourite questions to get the conversation moving:
    - **Identify:** These questions focus on what really matters for your report and what topics are worth spending more time on.
        - What’s top of mind for you right now?
        - What priorities are you thinking about this week?
        - What the best use of our time today?
    - **Understand:** Once you’ve identified a topic to discuss, these next questions get at the root of the problem and what can be done about it.
        - What does your ideal outcome look like?
        - What’s hard for you in getting to that outcome?
        - What do you really care about?
        - What do you think is the best course of action?
        - What’s the worst-case scenario you’re worried about?
    - **Support:** These questions zero in on how you can be of greatest service to your report.
        - How can I help you?
        - What can I do to make you more successful?
        - What was the most useful part of our conversation?
- p69: When we’re going through tough times, the thing that’s often the most helpful isn’t advice or answers but empathy.
- p70; “Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren’t always comfortable, but they’re never weaknesses.” — Brene Brown
- p70; I try to admit when I don’t have the answers or when I’m working through my own personal challenges. I’ll say things like the following:
    - I don’t know the answer. What do you think?
    - I want to come clean and apologise for what I did/said the other day…
    - One of my personal growth areas this half is…
    - I’m afraid I don’t know enough to help you with that problem. Here’s someone you should talk to instead…
- p72; In the same way that individuals should play to their strengths, so should you pay attention to your team’s top talent - the people who are doing well and could be doing even better.

### The art of feedback

- p80; Great managers are excellent coaches and the secret sauce to coaching is giving effective feedback.
- p84; mastering feedback means you can break down two of the biggest barriers preventing your reports from doing great work - unclear expectations and inadequate skills.
- p85; The feedback process should start before any work begins.
- p85; During this phase, you should agree:
    - What a great job looks like for your report, compared to a mediocre or bad job
    - What advice you have to help your report get started on the right foot
    - Common pitfalls you're report should avoid.
    - E.g.: “In your first three months on the job, I expect that you’ll build good relationships with your team, be able to ramp up on a small-scale starter project, and then share your first design iteration for review. I don’t expect you’ll get the green light right away, but if you do, that would be knocking it out the park.
- p86; Give task-specific feedback as frequently as you can
- p86; Task-specific feedback is most effective when the action performed is still fresh in your report’s memory, so share it as soon as you can.
- p87; When you give behavioural feedback, you are making a statement about how you perceive that person, so your words need to be thoughtfully considered and supported with specific examples to explain why you feel that way. It’s best discussed in person
- p88; 360-feedback: Every quarter, for each report, I send a short email to a handful of his or her closes collaborators asking: a) what is X doing especially well that X should do more of? and b) What should X change or stop doing?
- p93; does my feedback lead to the change I’m hoping for?
- p96; making sure your feedback is heard: follow up with “does this feedback resonate with you? Why or why not?”
- p97; end a conversation with “Okay, let’s make sure we’re on the same page - what are your takeaways and next steps?” → Then summarise via email what was discussed.
- p97; the third tactic is to help the person hear the same message many times from many sources.

### Managing yourself

- p109; Being a good manager is a highly personal journey, and if you don’t have a good handle on yourself, you won’t have a good handle on how to best support your team.
- p109; Get deep with knowing you - your strengths, your values, your comfort zones, your blind sports, and your biases.
- p112; recommended frameworks for understanding your strengths - StrenghtsFinder2.0 by Tom Rath or StandOut by Marcus Buckingham.
- p112; a quick version you can do yourself:
    - How would the people who know and like me best (family, significant other, close friends) describe me in three words?
    - What three qualities do I possess that I am the proudest of?
    - When I look back at something I did that was successful, what personal traits do I give credit to?
    - What are the three top most common pieces of positive feedback that I’ve received from my manager or peers?
- p113; the second part is getting to know your weaknesses and triggers:
    - Whenever my worst inner critic sits on my shoulder, what does he yell at me for?
    - If a magical fairy were to come and bestow on me three gifts I don’t yet have, what would they be?
    - What are three things that trigger me? (a trigger is a situation that gets me more worked up than it should)
    - What are the three most common pieces of feedback from my manager or peers on how I could be more effective?
- p115; in her book Midset, pioneering psychologist Carl Dweck describes how the two different mindsets - which she calls fixed and growth - make a huge difference in our performance and personal happiness.
- p119; habits to make it easier to operate in an ideal environment
    - Schedule half an hour of “daily prep” into my calendar so I can study my day and visualise how I want each meeting or work task to go
    - I schedule “thinking time” blocks on my calendar so I can sort through and write down my thoughts on a big problem
    - Twice a year I look back on the past six months and reflect on what I’ve gotten better at. Then, I set new learning goals for the next six months.
- p123; when feeling bad, try these two tactics:
    - First, conjure up an impact of a public figure you admire, someone who seems to have the perfect life and Googling “[person’s name] struggle”
    - The second tactic is to admit you’re feeling bad. I’ll take out a post-it note and write “I am super stressed out about X”
- p125; when a negative story takes hold of you, step back and question whether your interpretation is correct.
- p129; I started a journal called **Little Wins**. Every day, I’d jot down something I did that I was proud of, even if it was small.
- p132; **treat your manager as a coach**
- One of the biggest barriers I’ve found is that people shy away from asking their managers for help.I know that feeling well; for years, I held the mental model that my boss - like my teachers and professors of the past - was someone in a position of authority who took note of what I did and passed judgement on it, As such, how I interacted with my manager could be summarized in one neat statement: **Don’t mess it up**. I considered it a failure if my manager had to get involved in something I was responsible for.
- p133; the key is to treat your manager as a coach, not as a judge.
- p133; when I started to see 1:1s with my manager as an opportunity for focused learning, I got so much more out of it.
- p135; a Harvard Business School study shows that we learn more when we couple our experiences with periodic reflections.
- p135; Personally, I like to schedule an hour on my calendar at the end of every week to think about what I accomplished, what I’m satisfied or dissatisfied with, and what I’m taking away for the next week.
- p135; I also set personal goals and do bigger look-backs every six months, which gives me a longer time frame to tackle ambitious projects and learn new skills.

- p138; learning how to be a great leader means learning about your superpowers and flaws, learning how to navigate the obstacles in your head, and learning how to learn.

### Amazing Meetings
- p143; “there are only a handful of reasons for people to get together in person, so being crystal clear about the outcome you’re shooting for is the first step to running great meetings”
- p143; In a decision meeting, you’re framing the different options on the table and asking a decision-maker to make a call. Success here is both getting to a clear decision ****and**** everyone leaving with a sense of trust in the process.”
- p145; “As Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is fond of saying, “sometimes you have to disagree and commit for the sake of moving forward quickly”
- p145; A great decision-making meeting does the following:
    - Gets a decision made (obviously)
    - Includes the people most directly affected by the decision as well as a clearly designated decision-maker
    - Presents all credible options objectively and with relevant background information, and includes the team’s recommendation if there is one
    - Gives equal airtime to dissenting opinions and makes people feel that they were heard
- p146; a great informational meeting accomplishes the following:
    - Enables the group to feel like they learned something valuable
    - Conveys key messages clearly and memorably
    - Keeps the audience’s attention (through dynamic speakers, rich storytelling, skilled pacing, interactivity)
    - Evokes an intended emotion - whether inspiration, trust, pride, courage, empathy etc
- p147; A great feedback meeting achieves the following:
    - Gets everyone on the same page about what success for the project looks like
    - Honestly represents the current status of the work, including an assessment of how things are going, any changes since the last check-in, and what the future plans are
    - Clearly frames open questions, key decisions, or known concerns to get the most helpful feedback
    - Ends with an agreed-upon next steps (including when the next milestone or check-in will be)
- p149; a great team bonding meeting enables the following:
    - Creates better understanding and trust between participants
    - Encourages people to be open and authentic
    - Makes people feel cared for
- p152; “Sending out an agenda ahead of time shows a level of care and intentionality in helping the group stay focused. It’s a good idea to do this for meetings of any size, even 1:1s, but the larger the meeting, the more important the preparation.”
- p152; “After the meeting, the follow-ups need to be treated with as much care as the preparation. A single meeting is not an end unto itself; it is a stepping-stone in the much longer path of creating something valuable for the world.”
- p152; In the last few minutes of a meeting, get into the habit of asking, “so before we break, let’s make sure we agree on the next steps…” After the meeting, send out a recap to the attendees with a summary of the discussion, a list of specific action items and who is responsible for each, and when the next check-in will be.”
- p155; on changing up your meeting to encourage participation: “Another tactic I like is the “post-it-note” opening. Before launching into a discussion about a complex topic… give everyone a pad of post-it notes and ask them to write down their thoughts on the topic… Afterwards, each participant puts his or her notes up on the board and talks through their thinking. Similar ideas are clumped together and after the very last note has been added, the room discusses the various clumps.
