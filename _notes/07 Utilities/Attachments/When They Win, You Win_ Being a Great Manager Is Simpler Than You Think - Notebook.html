    Introduction
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Page 5 · Location 88
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    It starts with a simple and obvious idea: the only thing that we all have in common at work is that we want to be successful. It seems reasonable, then, that the best managers help each person understand what is expected of them and then help each person find success.
</div><div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
    3 → E ↔ R To put it in plain English, embrace these three (3) things—Direction, Coaching, Career—and as a manager of any organization, you will have engaged employees (E) who are delivering the expected results (R).

<div class="noteText">
    some common measurable engagement concepts below, along with some of the questions we ask to pin them down:
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Page 12 · Location 193
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Fulfillment—“ How fulfilled are you by the work that you do?” Discretionary Effort—“ How willing are you to put in effort beyond what is expected?” Pride in Employer—“ How much do you agree with the following statement: ‘I am proud to work at [Employer]’?” Employee Satisfaction (eSAT)—“ Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with [Employer] as a place to work?”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Page 12 · Location 198
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS)—“ How likely are you to recommend [Employer] as a place to work?” Intent to Leave/ Intent to Stay—“ How much do you agree with the following statement: ‘I am seriously considering leaving [Employer]’?”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Page 13 · Location 222
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The key point is that employee engagement is directly linked to the most important results that every company produces. It’s not a “soft measurement” off to the side; it’s integral.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Page 14 · Location 233
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    better engagement is a function of better management, and worse engagement is a function of worse management.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Page 15 · Location 251

<div class="noteText">
    To sum it up succinctly, engagement matters, managers are responsible for it, and engagement is awful everywhere.

    I owe it to myself to ask every so often whether what I’m currently working on is the most valuable thing I could be working on.

    Part I: The Argument for the Big 3
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 1. Restoring Dignity to the Office of the Manager > Page 30 · Location 453
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    To me, the job of the manager is so freakin’ simple, consisting of only two things, that it actually gets me a little hot under the collar when we overcomplicate it: Deliver an aligned result. Enable the success of the people on your teams.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 1. Restoring Dignity to the Office of the Manager > Page 32 · Location 476
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    High expectations are important, but clear expectations are crucial. By focusing on little more than the success of the folks on your team, you ensure that each member is pursuing their clearly articulated portion of the aligned result and that you, the manager—the one who is responsible for everything that the team does or fails to do—will deliver it.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 1. Restoring Dignity to the Office of the Manager > Page 32 · Location 484
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Direction in a manager’s job is less about setting direction and more about ensuring direction is set. Direction setting anchors the team to an aligned result through the combination of two long-term elements, purpose and vision, and two short-term elements: (1) objectives and key results (OKRs) and (2) ruthless prioritization. Coaching enables team members to achieve those results. It comes in two forms: coaching to improve what’s not working and coaching to continue what is working. The former involves giving feedback that, no matter how hard we try, almost always induces a threat response; the latter involves helping folks explicitly understand what they have done well so they can do more of it. Career is the most overlooked element, but it is critical to employee engagement. A manager must do more than help employees succeed in the job they are doing now; they must help them discover their long-term vision for their careers and show them what actions they can take right now that will allow them to make tangible progress toward it. In doing this, you show employees that your care for them extends beyond what they can do for you or the company.

<div class="noteText">
    What is unique about these findings, though, is that they add up to a simple, coherent, contiguous, and economical leadership method—the Big 3—that measurably, reliably, and predictably drives both engagement and results. Simply, 3 → E ↔ R.

<div class="noteText">
    Over my twenty-eight years of leading people, I learned that people need clear expectations, the autonomy to craft and pursue their agendas, support to achieve success, and help thinking about their careers. These can be further boiled down to the three things that managers must provide their people: Direction, Coaching, and Career.

<div class="noteText">
    There are two major sources that I recommend regarding OKRs. First, Measure What Matters, a book by venture capitalist John Doerr, is as close to the source of truth about this practice as there is. Second, Betterworks is a Silicon Valley company that builds software to help organizations develop and manage their OKRs in an aligned way, top to bottom. I don’t have an opinion about their software, but their blog and the “resources” section of their website are exceptional!

    OKRs are a goal-setting system, and are composed of two major parts—an objective, and then underneath each objective, one or more key results.

<div class="noteText">
    Third, they provide a basis for productive coaching. When we say that a manager’s job is to deliver an aligned result and enable the success of the people on their teams, the foundational idea beneath the aligned result is the OKR. That OKR invariably offers the manager a chance to enable greater success because it frequently reveals the need for a coaching intervention to improve, and it also reveals an opportunity to specifically call out great work by focusing on the things people should continue doing.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A bad OKR leaves us without crystal clarity on exactly how we will measure or identify success. For some, this ambiguity is designed to dodge accountability. If there isn’t clarity about the shot we’re calling now, we might have a better chance to revise history at the end of the quarter and shape things to look like we succeeded.

Each morning at 8: 30, the Slackbot automatically prompted us with this question: “What are you working on today?” Then each of my direct reports and I highlighted our top priorities for that day.

    Situation—Describe the situation (or context, scenario, or interaction type) and be specific about when and where the behavior occurred. Behavior—Describe the observable behavior. Ideally, the behaviors in question come from a source, such as a handbook, a list of core values, or a set of level and functional guidelines. Steer clear of projecting or interpreting, and stick with what you have observed. Impact—Describe what you believe to be the impact of the behavior.

It’s a great opportunity to teach your people about the broader context while giving them a better understanding of your thought processes. Try asking, “How can I help you have more success?” Establish Explicit Expectations: When you take the time to clearly communicate the behaviors and results you expect from your team members, it increases their certainty, reduces their stress and worry, and increases their probability of success. It’s also a critical inclusive leadership behavior, as you tend to communicate most clearly with those who are like you. Do this well for everyone on your team, and you set everyone up for success.
