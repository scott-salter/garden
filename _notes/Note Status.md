title: Explained: Note Status
---

With each note I add to my digital garden, I include a note status to show how developed an idea is. And with this being a [[Digital Garden]], each note status uses a gardening analogy to reflects the maturity of the idea.

## My Note Statuses

- **Seed:** a seed of an idea. This is an idea or thought that I have just planted, but have not done any further reading or research on. 
- **Seedling**: the initial seed of an idea has been tended to, but it is still a young idea. I've likely done some initial reading or research on the idea.
- **Sapling:** an established idea, but one that needs planting among other trees. 
- **Evergreen:** stable, fundamental units of knowledge work.
